# azarte: telegram bot

This is the code for a telegram bot. The idea is to play with randomness artistically but directly in a chat.
It is part of **azarte** project obviously.  

## online status

**Azarte Bot** is not currently deployed. It will be available during some moments of the week while I run
some tests. Stay tuned!

## commands

Here you can see the list of available commands. Some of them allow you to pass parameters.

- **/start**: returns simply a gretting.  
- **/attractor**: returns a random strange attractor. They are so beautiful.  
- **/poem**: returns a random poem built specially for you.  
- **/number (f)**: returns a random number rolling a dice with *f* faces.  
- **/sequence (f) (n)**: returns a random sequence of *n* numbers rolling a dice with *f* faces.  
- **/help**: returns a link to bring you here.
