A;B;C
I imagine an exciting match;although at times boring and slow;in which victory could go to either side.
I don't imagine much of a match;a game with a tight midfield and full of imprecise counterattacks;with mistakes on both sides.
There are many games that I imagine better than this one;an inconsequential fight between two bad teams;with occasional off-sides.
I see a confrontation full of controversy;with very debatable refereeing decisions;with thousands of balls to the stands.
A bad game;with very little to comment on really;I'm not sure this is what soccer is all about.
What an interesting match;full of shots of the stands doing the wave;with goals for and against.
I think it will be the best match of the tournament;with players running thousands of miles;with balls exploding from the heat.
A confrontation of classes;where forwards and defenders get confused all the time;a party of bad decisions.
An incredible match;with lyrical chants in the stands;with dozens of balls hitting the post.
