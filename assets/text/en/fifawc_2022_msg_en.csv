A;B;C
I imagine an exciting match;although at times boring and slow;in which victory could go to either side.
I don't imagine much of a match;a game with a tight midfield and full of imprecise counterattacks;with mistakes on both sides.
There are many games that I imagine better than this one;an inconsequential fight between two bad teams;with occasional off-sides.
I see a confrontation full of controversy;with very debatable refereeing decisions;with thousands of balls to the stands.
A bad game;with very little to comment on really;I'm not sure this is what soccer is all about.
What an interesting match;full of shots of the stands doing the wave;with goals for and against.
I think it will be the best match of the tournament;with players running thousands of miles;with balls exploding from the heat.
A confrontation of classes;where forwards and defenders get confused all the time;a party of bad decisions.
An incredible match;with lyrical chants in the stands;with dozens of balls hitting the post.
A match typical of this unpredictable World Cup;with many interventions of VAR;with lots of disallowed goals.
There are entertaining matches and there is this one;very cut up with fouls and full of colored cards;a fight between hooligans.
The stands emptied before the end of this boring match;with 2 or 3 spiked balls as the most exciting thing;in which nobody got excited.
A tough clash of powers;two teams with no ideas to circulate the ball;with a ball that nobody knew how to find.
A match that will be remembered forever;with incredible performances of Hollywood stars in the stands;full of crosses to nowhere and intergalactic shots.
The deafening noise of the crowd could not be heard the whole match;the players could not find the goal during the ninety minutes;nothing happened in the added time.
A great match to rent a helicopter and watch from above;with a fast and precise ball circulation;with counterattacks cut with violent fouls.
Few matches like this one to have time to make coffee in the middle of the first half;nothing happened during the first 45 minutes;nothing happened during the last 45 minutes.
The match with the best goal of the World Cup;with thousands of precise passes and accurate shots;perhaps we will never see a match like this again.
The match to watch again and again;a match that you start to understand after watching it 2 or 3 times;with an open result until the last second.
