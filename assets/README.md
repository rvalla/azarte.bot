# azarte: telegram bot assets

Here are the persistent assets. Many of the pictures, sounds or texts the *bot* sends are created
at the moment for the user who ask for them. However sometimes the *bot* use a text file to create
a random poem or simply chose a beautiful strange attractor to share.  

Reach **azarte bot** [here](https://t.me/azarte_bot).
Feel free to contact me by [mail](mailto:rodrigovalla@protonmail.ch) or reach me in
[telegram](https://t.me/rvalla) or [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@rvalla).
